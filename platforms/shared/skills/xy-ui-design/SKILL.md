# xy-ui-design

## Usage Boundaries

Follow the current Task Pack, applicable project standards, and the permanent responsibilities of
`xy-uiux`. Loading this Skill does not grant write authority or change the task level, implementer,
user's prototype choice, UI-Conformance, approvals, or the single independent QA route. The PM's
selected `design_mode` determines the applicable stage; preloading does not require every branch.

- `prototype`: Work only within the currently authorized required-prototype scope and deliver
  stable, build-free, directly openable, high-fidelity interactive HTML. Early wireframes serve only
  IA and option comparison; they cannot be the final prototype.
- `standards_only`: Maintain only the precisely authorized design-standard leaves under the existing
  `xy-workflow/references/design-standards.md`; do not write HTML/CSS, run prototype verification,
  or request visual approval.
- Production implementation and QA: Read and consume only the currently adopted design authority
  and applicable professional rules. Do not use this Skill to change design direction, expand
  owned_paths, or restore prototype gates for waived/UI-Conformance work.

## Baseline and Design Analysis

The following design operations apply to authorized `xy-uiux` tasks; production implementation and
QA consume applicable rules against existing authority without executing design stages or triggering
prototype verification. Read the applicable clauses in [design foundations](references/foundations-rules.md)
and [component interactions](references/components-rules.md) for general rules; the project retains only
its actually adopted tokens, styles, dimensions, platform mappings, and business differences. When a
project-specific standards index exists, follow its actual links, then check relevant product evidence
and current pages. Reuse context that has been read in full and remains unchanged; do not assume leaf
filenames or preload the entire project. Approved requirements and project rules take precedence.
Reuse `ui-ux-pro-max` for design analysis, choosing the smallest relevant queries according to its
instructions. Results are advisory only: do not persist another design system, invoke installation or
build flows, or let generic styles replace the project baseline.

## Read by Stage

For design analysis, page refinement, or standards maintenance, read
[design quality and completion criteria](references/design-quality.md). Address content hierarchy,
components, states, platforms, and accessibility as applicable to the current task; do not expand
design scope to fill a checklist.

<!-- workflow-contract: references/design-quality.md -->

Only when organizing pages and presentation in `prototype` mode, read the
[HTML prototype canvas](references/prototype-canvas.md). It carries forward the role's existing canvas
contract without requiring unrelated page rework or adding prototypes to direct-development branches.

## Verification and Handoff

For `prototype`, the design Agent self-checks requirement coverage, standards conformance, and
delivery consistency, reusing `xy-prototype-verify` static verification and the five-section in-page
contract. Hand off results through the existing `static_checks`, `blocking_findings`, and `result`;
do not create independent prototype QA, reports, or approvals. Final confirmation remains with the
user. Hand off only concrete pages, scope, operations, shared impact, real evidence, and unverified
items to the PM. Static success does not establish visual satisfaction or correctness of all
interactions; the PM still handles user visual confirmation through the existing route. Do not
generate, save, attach, or present screenshots. Do not automate prototype browser operations by
default; preserve only the user-request/failure-diagnosis exceptions in the existing verification
contract. PM semantic review and QA boundaries continue to use that contract.
In the existing handoff, return requirement coverage by stable REQ identifiers with concrete pages
and actual state anchors. The PM writes these back to the single requirements Markdown.
Requirements/plan Markdown-to-HTML generation is retired under [the retained reference](../xy-plan/references/requirements-markdown.md);
keep any existing HTML as historical material without requiring an update.
The design Agent does not edit the PM's source or create a mapping report; this association does not
change the prototype page, dependency fingerprint, or visual-approval contract.

For `standards_only`, return rule differences, their basis, applicability, and existing document
validation results. Distinguish candidates, adopted rules, and completed production migration; do not
add prototype requirements because HTML or browser evidence is absent. Reuse unchanged rules and do
not create extra reports, approval files, or memory records for closeout.
